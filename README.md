# EmojiFilter
A fun tool for applying an emoji filter to images.
Initially a random Emoji has the filter applied but you can drag and drop your own image and watch the filter work its magic.

Emoji values are generated from the images pixels using an OctTree to find the emoji with the closest average color value
